# SensingUrbanClimate

This repo is a host of codes for the paper *Sensing Climate Justice: A Multi-Hyper Graph Approach for Classifying Urban Heat and Flood Vulnerability through Street View Imagery* published in Sustainable Cities and Society (doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2024.106016)



This repo contains two jupyternote book files: London_dataProcess.ipynb and multi_hyper.ipynb. London_dataProcess.ipynb is a demonstration of how to prepare the graph data and multi_hyper.ipynb conatins our proposed Multi-Hyper Graph Neural Network and training demonstration. 

The following Package for the execution of the codes will be required:

1. PyG (PyTorch Geometric)
2. Networkx
3. Pandas
4. geopandas
5. libpysal
6. shapely
7. jenkspy
